# Supabase Production Setup Guide

## Phase 1 Completed ✅

### Project Details
- **Project Name**: invoice-direct-production
- **Project URL**: [Your URL from dashboard]
- **Region**: [Your selected region]

### API Keys Obtained
- ✅ Project URL
- ✅ Anon Public Key  
- ✅ Service Role Key

### Authentication Configured
- ✅ Site URL set
- ✅ Redirect URLs configured
- ✅ Email confirmations disabled (for easier testing)
- ✅ Password requirements set

## Next Steps

### Update Your .env File
Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
```

### Test Connection
After updating `.env`:
1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try signing up with a test email
3. Check if the user appears in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users

## Security Notes
- ✅ Service role key is kept secure (not in frontend code)
- ✅ Anon key is safe for frontend use
- ✅ RLS policies will be set up in Phase 2

## Troubleshooting
If you see connection errors:
1. Double-check the URL format (should include https://)
2. Verify the anon key is copied completely
3. Make sure there are no extra spaces in the .env file
4. Restart the development server after changes
